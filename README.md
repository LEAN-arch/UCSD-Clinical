## üìñ Overview

The **Scientific QA Command Center** is a Streamlit-based web application designed to provide the leadership of a Clinical Trials Office with a data-driven, interactive platform for quality oversight. It moves beyond traditional, reactive QA methods by integrating predictive analytics, statistical process control, and performance benchmarking.

The dashboard simulates a realistic CTO environment, including a portfolio of clinical trials, audit findings, QA team metrics, and strategic initiatives. This allows for a robust demonstration of modern QA principles and their impact on clinical trial performance.

## üß† Key Concepts

This dashboard is built around several key concepts from modern Quality Management Systems (QMS) and project management:

| Acronym   | Concept                               | Description                                                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **RBQM**  | Risk-Based Quality Management         | An approach that focuses QA resources on the most critical risks to patient safety and data integrity.               |
| **SPC**   | Statistical Process Control           | A method for monitoring, controlling, and improving a process through statistical analysis.                          |
| **CAPA**  | Corrective and Preventive Action      | A systematic process for investigating and correcting discrepancies to prevent their recurrence.                       |
| **CPI/SPI** | Cost/Schedule Performance Index       | Metrics from Earned Value Management to assess project health. A value > 1.0 is favorable.                         |
| **GCP**   | Good Clinical Practice                | An international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, and reporting clinical trials.     |
